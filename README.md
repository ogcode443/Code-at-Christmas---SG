Building a fun what to gift Christmas themed website
# 🎄 What To Gift Here

**What To Gift Here** is a cozy, storybook-style Christmas web experience designed to help people find thoughtful gift ideas through a short quiz, playful character reveals, and aesthetic gift recommendations.

This project was built as a **fun, emotion-first hackathon demo** — focused on delight, warmth, and visual storytelling rather than real e-commerce or heavy AI.

## ✨ Inspiration

Every Christmas, the hardest part isn’t buying a gift — it’s *deciding* what feels right.

What To Gift Here reimagines gifting as a warm North Pole experience:
- No endless scrolling
- No pressure on price
- Just a few intuitive questions and a little Christmas magic

The goal was to create something that feels:
- Cozy
- Playful
- Personal
- Screenshot-worthy

## 🧠 How Recommendations Work

This project uses **rule-based logic**, not machine learning.

### Quiz → Tags → Gifts

1. Each quiz answer maps to **tags**  
   (e.g. `cozy`, `trendy`, `sentimental`, `chaotic`)

2. Each archetype has a predefined tag profile

3. The archetype with the highest tag overlap is selected

4. Gifts are filtered by:
   - Budget tier
   - Archetype compatibility
   - Surprise slider value

5. The top 6–8 matching gifts are displayed

This approach keeps the experience:
- Predictable
- Transparent
- Demo-friendly
- Judge-explainable

## 🎭 Christmas Archetypes

Some examples used in the experience:

- **The Cindy Lou of Christmas**
